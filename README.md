# Music Generation using LSTM

This project demonstrates music generation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It uses the Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD) as the training data to generate new musical compositions. The input for the model is MIDI-like Notes, the output will be newly generated MIDI-like Notes, which once put into a software like IDI player or a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software, this will  interpret the MIDI-like Notes and produce the corresponding audio output.

## Dataset

The Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD) is a large collection of MIDI files containing musical compositions across various genres. It can be downloaded from [this website](http://hog.ee.columbia.edu/craffel/lmd/lmd_full.tar.gz). The dataset consists of MIDI files representing musical notes, timing, and other musical parameters.

## Usage

1. Download and extract the Lakh MIDI Dataset by following the link provided above.
2. Place the extracted MIDI files in the `data` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to run the data preprocessing, model training, and music generation steps.
4. Refer to the documentation in the notebooks for detailed instructions and explanations.
